Client Meeting Notes (02-02-2023):

- General goal: make the data easy for marketing to build an audience and implement new strategies.
- Figure out the different customer segments and the similarities between them: aggressive growth, moderate growth, new customers, unsure customers, etc.
    - Focus on identifying around 7 clusters. Number could be more or less depending on the data trends we notice.
- Separating customers into common characteristics would allow clients to make informed strategic decisions around product offerings, feature requests, and ensure that the value we provide to our customers is in line with what they need to grow their business. 
- Additional Reach Goal: Open source scraping of data from competing websites. 
    - It seems like Jason really wants it more as a post-MVP goal rather than a reach. Need to discuss with Mike.
    - Check legal constraints for the scraping.
- End product would be reproducible commented code (R, python) to replicate the process. 
- Actionable items:
    - Finalize SOW based on feedback from Jason.
    - Organize Github by weeks, including client meeting notes, team meeting notes, activity log.
    - Change PDF files on Github to markdown.
