- Way to tackle the different tiers problem (where clientâ€™s goal is to figure out which ones lawyers should step 
  up a tier or go down a tier):
    - Classification problem, predict their tier of the lawyer.
    - Input is the features we know about customers, such as AOP, etc.
    - The machine learning model will predict the appropriate tier based on input information about the client.
        - Example, if the model is predicting a higher tier than a customer is currently at, then competitors are outspending 
          them on a package, so the client should focus on this customer and convince them to go up a tier.
- Each row is a customer for only 1 month.
- Not just give them the model for which clients should go up or down, but also give them the reason why based on 
  the input variables that are having the biggest effect on outcome.
- There could be a case where Avvo recommends a client to go down a tier, even though they would pay less, this would mean 
  that they would remain a client with Avvo for longer which would mean they would make more money off that specific client.
- Steps for next week:
    - Ensure you have access to the remote desktop.
    - Create a summary dataset where each row is a customer. Add columns that track their progression of tiers over time, 
      either by month or by year.
    - Have the model set up.
