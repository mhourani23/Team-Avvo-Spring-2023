- Better to focus on one state rather than try and do a bunch of different states. We currently have New York, Texas, and California.
- Nice to have: present the code that can be used for more states. Setting up a blueprint for future use by other teams.
- What factors should we be including for our groups / representative examples:
    - Size of firm. Well established.
    - Size of firm. Mid-sized, billboard law.
    - Size of firm. Very new.
    - Area of expertise, elder law.
    - Area of expertise, education law.
    - General practice lawyer.
- March 9th meet with the teamâ€™s data analyst to ask questions about the data.
