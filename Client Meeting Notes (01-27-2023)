Client Meeting Notes (01-27-2023):

- Data Set: based on attorneys' data from Avvo. It is like Yelp for attorneys.
- How they make money: Attorneys pay money to be on different listings and get more traffic on their profile through the Avvo website.
- Last semester: students joined the Avvo provided data set with another data set. There were some discrepancies between both sets that needed to be addressed. Different segments were created, but they did not have enough time to convert their findings into a proposal for the marketing team.
- Objective this semester: this semester we need to polish up the segments and connect them to a proposal that can be presented to the marketing and sales departments. We will read the prior semester’s work and recommend how to put it into operation for marketing and sales. 
- We will get access to Google Drive with last semester’s research.
- There are job opportunities for analysts and interns available, contact Jason to learn more. March would be the time to start looking/inquiring. 
- Next steps:
    - Need to figure out a time to meet once a week for 30 minutes. Fill out When2Meet in the email sent.
    - Set up google drive access. Jason will provide this.
    - Read materials that Jason will send on email.
