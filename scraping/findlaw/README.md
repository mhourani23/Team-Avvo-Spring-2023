# **Findlaw Scraping**  

Currently have scraper that returns lawyers on platform given the county, state, and sector.  
Finished scraper that gets all different types of legal issues offered on findlaw. 

## Website Order: State -> County -> Issue  
### Using county level the link order is 
```
Legal Issue -> County -> State
https://lawyers.findlaw.com/lawyer/firm/banking-finance-law/marin-county/california
```

Working on:  
County scraper when given state name  

Future:  
Some way to extract states/territories of the USA. Could scrape from website but in weird format.
