# **Findlaw Scraping**  

Currently have scraper that returns lawyers on platform given the county, state, and sector.  
Also almost done on a scraper that gets all different types of legal issues. 


Working on:  
County scraper when given state name  

Future:  
Some way to extract states/territories of the USA. Could scrape from website but in weird format.
